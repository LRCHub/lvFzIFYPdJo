When the sun goes down
Tell me, will we live to tell
The mystery of midnight and it's spell
When the sun goes down

The darkness falls
There's no one in sight
From my window
These city streets
Are hiding from light
There's nowhere to go

We're on the edge
Of feeling the despair
I hear a voice
From beyond the atmosphere
Will the true unknown
Leave us so alone

When the sun goes down
Will you hear the cry
Or just walk on by
And leave without a sound
When the sun goes down
Tell me, will we live to tell
The mystery of midnight and it's spell
When the sun goes down

Those unafraid
Will make the escape
To safer places
But where it's cold
They freeze and they wait
For you to save them

We're on the edge
Of feeling the despair
I hear a voice
From beyond the atmosphere
Will the true unknown
Leave us so alone

When the sun goes down
Will you hear the cry
Or just walk on by
And leave without a sound
When the sun goes down
Tell me, will we live to tell
The mystery of midnight and it's spell
When the sun goes down

I wanna burn
Burn a candle you can see
The kinda flame
I need you to believe
That the creatures of
The night will never leave

When the sun goes down
Tell me, will we live to tell
The mystery of midnight and it's spell
When the sun goes down

When the sun goes down
Tell me, will we live to tell
The mystery of midnight and it's spell
When the sun goes down

When the sun goes down
Tell me, will we live to tell
The mystery of midnight and it's spell
When the sun goes down
